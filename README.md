# üí´ About Me:
I have a passion for all things tech, from cars to computers. I enjoy exploring new technologies and challenging myself with all different kinds of software and hardware. Proficient in Python and Java, and also have experience with SQL, R, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS I'm driven by a desire to use technology to solve real-world problems and make everyone's everyday lives just a little bit easier. Currently exploring AI and its applications in current software. Actively involved in professional career development through programs like Codepath as well as through my community. Most of all, I love to teach others! Did you know that the very first webcam was invented only to watch a coffee pot? Simple ideas like these end up becoming the biggest innovations in our society.
